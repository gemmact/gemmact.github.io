My research interests are in the broad areas of computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on deep learning. Particularly, I have an interest in image generation and my current research is in Multimodal Image Generation using Diffusion Models.\nPreviously, I studied Mathematics and Physics Engineering at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC) under the double degree program of CFIS (Center for high interdisciplinary training). During my last year, I completed my thesis in University of Toronto, advised by Prof. Sven Dickinson. Later on, I completed the Masters in Computer Vision organized by Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona (UAB) where I worked with Montse PardÃ s for my dissertation.\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I worked as a software developer for two summer internships at Wiris Math and BaseTIS. While studying my masters, I concurrently worked part time in the former start-up Vilynx, taking part in different NLP projects. Finally, right before starting my PhD I spent 6 months at InterDigital, working as a research intern under the supervision of Louis Chevallier.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in knowing more about my work, check out my publications or feel free to contact me.\n","date":"27 October 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"About me","summary":"I am currently a second year Computer Vision PhD student advised by Prof.","title":"About me"},{"content":"","date":"27 October 2022","permalink":"/about/mypost/","section":"About me","summary":"Thinking Outside the BBox: Unconstrained Generative Object Compositing","title":"Latest publication: ECCV 2024"},{"content":" Find below a list of the latest publications I have contributed to.
